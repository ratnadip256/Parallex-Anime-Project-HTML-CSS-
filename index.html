          • Satoru Gojo is one of the main protagonists of the popular manga and
          anime series Jujutsu Kaisen. He is widely recognized as the strongest
          jujutsu sorcerer in the world, a title he earned by inheriting both
          the Limitless and the Six Eyes techniques, a feat not achieved in over
          400 years. Gojo is a proud member of the Gojo Clan and serves as a
          teacher at Tokyo Jujutsu High, where he mentors and protects his
          students with unparalleled skill and dedication. <br /><br />
          • Despite his immense power, Gojo is known for his carefree and
          playful personality. He often covers his eyes with a black blindfold,
          which he can see through thanks to his supernatural abilities. His
          bright-blue eyes, known as the Six Eyes, grant him extraordinary
          powers, including heightened perception and the ability to manipulate
          cursed energy. Gojo's charisma and unwavering commitment to his
          students make him a beloved character among fans of the series.
